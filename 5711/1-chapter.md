My revered father-in-law, the Rebbe, of blessed memory, begins with a verse from _Shir HaShirim_,[1](javascript:doFootnote\('1a115101'\);) which serves as an analogy for the ongoing love relationship between G‑d and His bride, the Jewish people.כותב כ"ק מו"ח אדמו"ר, במאמרו ליום הסתלקותו, יו"ד שבט השי"ת:

“I have come into My garden, My sister, My bride.”בָּאתִי לְגַנִּי אֲחֹתִי כַלָּה,

_[Shir HaShirim](/library/bible_cdo/aid/15780/jewish/Shir-Hashirim-Song-of-Songs.htm "Shir Hashirim (Song of Songs)")_ Rabbah (on this verse) observes that the word used is not _legan_ which would mean “to the garden,” but _legan_i which means “to My garden,” but which our Sages interpret as meaningוְאִיתָא בְּמִדְרָשׁ רַבָּה (בִּמְקוֹמוֹ) לַגַּן אֵין כְּתִיב כָּאן אֶלָּא לְגַנִּי,

“to My bridal chamber.”[2](javascript:doFootnote\('2a115101'\);)לִגְנוּנִי,

The _Midrash_ explains that the verse is referring to the time of the Giving of the Torah[3](javascript:doFootnote\('3a115101'\);) and the construction of the Sanctuary. At that time, [G‑d](/library/article_cdo/aid/433240/jewish/God.htm "God in Judaism") “came into His garden,” i.e., His Presence was manifest in this world, which can be described as a garden.[4](javascript:doFootnote\('4a115101'\);) However, the verse does not merely say, “I came into the garden.” It says “My garden,” implying that G‑d shared a connection with the garden beforehand. The Divine Presence is thus saying: “Although for a time, I have been removed from the world, now — with the Giving of the [Torah](/library/article_cdo/aid/1426382/jewish/Torah.htm "What Is the Torah?") and the construction of the Sanctuary – I have come into My garden, My bridal chamber,

into the place in which My Essence was originally revealed.”לַמָּקוֹם שֶׁהָיָה עִקָּרִי בִּתְחִלָּה,

The _[Midrash](/library/article_cdo/aid/2398444/jewish/Midrash.htm "Midrash")_ continues: “...for the essence of the _Shechinah_, the Divine Presence, was manifest in the lower realms.” Although the _Midrash_ uses a plural term, _tachtonim_, the intent is our material world, as explained at length in sec. 2.דְּעִיקַּר שְׁכִינָה בַּתַּחְתּוֹנִים הָיְתָה.

This concludes the wording of the _Midrash_.עַד כָּאן לְשׁוֹנוֹ.

To focus on the expression “the essence of the _[Shechinah](/library/article_cdo/aid/2438527/jewish/The-Shechina.htm "Who Is Shechinah, And What Does She Want from My Life?")_”:וּלְהָבִין דִּיּוּק הַלָּשׁוֹן עִיקַּר שְׁכִינָה,

The Alter Rebbe states[5](javascript:doFootnote\('5a115101'\);) that this name is used to describe the Divine Presence “because it dwells and is enclothed in all the worldsהִנֵּה בְּפֵרוּשׁ שְׁכִינָה מְבָאֵר כ"ק אַדְמוֹ"ר הַזָּקֵן שֶׁנִּקְרָא שְׁכִינָה עַל שֵׁם שֶׁשּׁוֹכֶנֶת וּמִתְלַבֶּשֶׁת,

There are two dimensions to the [Alter Rebbe](/library/article_cdo/aid/77049/jewish/The-Alter-Rebbe.htm "The Alter Rebbe")’s definition: a) that the light descends and is revealed in the lower realms; and b) that it is “enclothed” in those realms. The latter term implies that just as clothes are tailored to fit the person who wears them, _G‑d’s_ Divine light undergoes an adjustment so that it can be internalized within the worlds in which it shines. The term _Shechinah_ thus implies not only _gilui_ (“revelation”), but also _hislabshus_ (“enclothing”).

– as in the Scriptural phrase,[6](javascript:doFootnote\('6a115101'\);) ‘And I will dwell among them.’” –מִלְּשׁוֹן "וְשָׁכַנְתִּי בְּתוֹכָם",

The _Shechinah_ represents the initial revelation of Or Ein Sof, _G‑d’s_ infinite light.שֶׁהוּא רֵאשִׁית הִתְגַּלּוּת אוֹר אֵין סוֹף.

From the Alter Rebbe’s statement[7](javascript:doFootnote\('7a115101'\);) that “the initial revelation of [Or Ein Sof](/library/article_cdo/aid/2123175/jewish/Ohr-Ein-Sof.htm "Ohr Ein Sof Made Simple")” is called _Shechinah_,וְהִנֵּה מִמַּה שֶׁכּוֹתֵב שֶׁרֵאשִׁית הִתְגַּלּוּת אוֹר אֵין סוֹף נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה,

As the _maamar_ proceeds to explain, the term _Shechinah_ applies on many levels, for every rung in the Spiritual Cosmos stems from a higher rung, which invests its lowest dimension in the new, subordinate framework that comes into being.[8](javascript:doFootnote\('8a115101'\);) The Alter Rebbe is referring to the highest level of the Spiritual Cosmos that can be termed _Shechinah_.

it is evident that the _Shechinah_ _transcends_ by far even the loftiest of the Four Spiritual Worlds, the World of _Atzilus_.מוּבָן מִזֶּה שֶׁעִנְיַן שְׁכִינָה הוּא לְמַעְלָה מַעְלָה מֵאֲצִילוּת גַּם כֵּן,

Indeed, the _Shechinah_ surpasses the Divine light that precedes the initial self-imposed contraction of Divine revelation that is known as the _tzimtzum_,גַּם בִּבְחִינַת הָאוֹר שֶׁלִּפְנֵי הַצִּמְצוּם,

for the initial revelation occurs in the Or Ein Sof that precedes the _[tzimtzum](/library/article_cdo/aid/2853891/jewish/Tzimtzum.htm "Tzimtzum")_.שֶׁהֲרֵי רֵאשִׁית הַהִתְגַּלּוּת הוּא בְּאוֹר אֵין סוֹף שֶׁלִּפְנֵי הַצִּמְצוּם,

And the Mitteler Rebbe writes:[9](javascript:doFootnote\('9a115101'\);) “The ray of the _kav_ and chut, i.e., the narrow vector and thread of Divine light that shined forth following the _tzimtzum_, in relation to the essence of _G‑d’s_ [infinite light](/library/article_cdo/aid/2123175/jewish/Ohr-Ein-Sof.htm "Ohr Ein Sof Made Simple"), is termed _Shechinah_.”וּכְמוֹ שֶׁכָּתַב כ"ק אַדְמוֹ"ר הָאֶמְצָעִי כִּי הֶאָרַת הַקַּו וְחוּט לְגַבֵּי עַצְמִיּוּת אוֹר אֵין סוֹף נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה.

For the meaning of the term _Shechinah_ varies according to the spiritual level of its context.כִּי עִנְיַן שְׁכִינָה הוּא בְּכָל מָקוֹם לְפִי עִנְיָנוֹ.

In relation to _[Atzilus](/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/431124/jewish/Close-to-the-Light.htm "Close to the Light")_, for example, it is _Malchus_, lit., “sovereignty,” the lowest of the _Sefiros_, that is termed _Shechinah_.לְגַבֵּי אֲצִילוּת הִנֵּה הַמַּלְכוּת נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה.

Even with regard to this use of the term, the Tzemach Tzedek explains[10](javascript:doFootnote\('10a115101'\);) that it applies only when _[Malchus](/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380807/jewish/Malchut.htm "<i>Malchut</i>")_ descends and serves as the rung of Atik, i.e., when it serves as the source for the creation of, the World of _Beriah_,וְגַם בָּזֶה מַה שֶּׁמַּלְכוּת דַּאֲצִילוּת נִקְרָא שְׁכִינָה מְבָאֵר כ"ק אַדְמוֹ"ר הַצֶּמַח צֶדֶק שֶׁזֶּהוּ דַּוְקָא כְּמוֹ שֶׁנַּעֲשֵׂית בְּחִינַת עַתִּיק לְעוֹלַם הַבְּרִיאָה,

for only then can it be said to enclothe itself in the lower levels of existence.

The passage _Pasach Eliyahu_[11](javascript:doFootnote\('11a115101'\);) refers to _Malchus_ with the analogy of a mouth, i.e., man’s power of speech. In speech, there are two dimensions: a) a person’s potential to speak, i.e., one of the powers of his soul; and b) the actual words he says which can be appreciated by others as well.

However, when _Malchus_ is still in _Atzilus_, it is united with them (i.e., with the _[Sefiros](/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380812/jewish/Emanations-Interact.htm "Emanations Interact")_ of _Atzilus_),אֲבָל בִּהְיוֹתָהּ בַּאֲצִילוּת הִיא מְיֻחֶדֶת עִמָּהֶם (עִם הַסְּפִירוֹת דַּאֲצִילוּת),

This parallels the power of speech as it exists within a person’s own set of potentials.

and the term _Shechinah_ cannot be applied to it. Only when it descends to the lower realms – like a person who speaks to others – is the use of that term appropriate.וְלֹא שַׁיָּךְ לְשׁוֹן שְׁכִינָה.

Nevertheless, this does not contradict the earlier statement that even so lofty a level as the _[kav](/library/article_cdo/aid/3201311/jewish/Covert-Luminosity.htm "Covert Luminosity")_, which is spiritually superior by far to _Atzilus_, is termed _Shechinah_,וּמִכָּל מָקוֹם אֵין זֶה סוֹתֵר לְמַה שֶּׁנִּתְבָּאֵר לְעֵיל שֶׁהַקַּו נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה,

for the term _Shechinah_ as used by our Sages refers specifically to the level of _Malchus_ of _Atzilus_,כִּי שְׁכִינָה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר בְּדִבְרֵי רַזַ"ל הַיְינוּ מַלְכוּת דַּאֲצִילוּת,

and even then, only insofar as it becomes the level of Atik for the World of _[Beriah](/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/431125/jewish/The-World-of-Creation.htm "The World of Creation")_.וְאַף גַּם זֹאת רַק כְּשֶׁנַּעֲשֵׂית בְּחִינַת עַתִּיק לַבְּרִיאָה דַּוְקָא,

In its source, however, i.e., in the state in which it exists in relation to _G‑d’s_ infinite light, i.e., the revelation of light that precedes the _tzimtzum_,אֲבָל בְּשָׁרְשָׁהּ, הַיְינוּ כְּמוֹ שֶׁהוּא לְגַבֵּי אוֹר אֵין סוֹף,

even the _kav_ is termed _Shechinah_.הִנֵּה גַּם הַקַּו נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה.

The Rebbe Maharash writes[12](javascript:doFootnote\('12a115101'\);) that one of the reasons why the _kav_ is called _Shechinah_ in relation to _G‑d’s_ infinite light is –וְאַחַד הַטְּעָמִים מַה שֶּׁהַקַּו נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה לְגַבֵּי אוֹר אֵין סוֹף, כָּתַב כ"ק אַדְמוֹ"ר מהר"ש

Explanation is necessary, because even though the _kav_ represents a descent in relation to the light that shines before the _tzimtzum_, the second dimension of the definition of the term _Shechinah_ seemingly does not apply to it. For the _kav_ itself is not enclothed in the worlds but is merely a vector of light. Nevertheless, the term is appropriate

because the _kav_ is drawn down with the intent that it become enclothed in the worlds and in the souls of the Jewish people.לְפִי שֶׁהַקַּו כַּוָּנַת הַמְשָׁכָתוֹ בִּשְׁבִיל שֶׁיִּתְלַבֵּשׁ בָּעוֹלָמוֹת וְנִשְׁמוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל,

Hence, even its initial revelation which is not enclothed in the worldsוְלָכֵן הִנֵּה גַּם בְּרֵאשִׁיתוֹ

is termed _Shechinah_ because of that intent.נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה.

On an even higher level, in its initial source, as it precedes the _tzimtzum_, there is a loftier definition of the term _Shechinah_.וּלְמַעְלָה יוֹתֵר שְׁכִינָה בְּשָׁרְשׁוֹ הָרִאשׁוֹן לְמַעְלָה מֵהַצִּמְצוּם,

As the Rebbe Rashab explains,[13](javascript:doFootnote\('13a115101'\);)מְבָאֵר כ"ק אַדְמוֹ"ר נ"ע

the revelation of Divine light prior to the tzim­tzum is termed _Shechinah_.שֶׁגִּלּוּי הָאוֹר כְּמוֹ שֶׁהוּא לִפְנֵי הַצִּמְצּום, נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה.

As explained, the term _Shechinah_ implies two functions: _gilui_, “revelation,” and _hislabshus_, “enclothing.” Before the _tzimtzum_, there was _gilui_, but seemingly the concept of _hislabshus_ does not apply because on that level of being, it is incorrect to speak of the existence – indeed, even the possibility for the existence – of the worlds, let alone _G‑d’s_ light adapting and being enclothed in them. To explain how the term _Shechinah_ can nevertheless apply even before the _tzimtzum_:

In general, there are three levels of G‑dly light that precede the _tzimtzum_. First, there are two fundamental divisions:שֶׁבִּכְלָלוּת הָאוֹר שֶׁלִּפְנֵי הַצִּמְצוּם יֵשׁ בּוֹ ג' מַדְרֵגוֹת,

the essence of the Divine light (etzem ha’or), which is _above_ all revelation,עֶצֶם הָאוֹר

and the diffusion of the light (hispa_shtus_ ha’or). On this level, the concept of revelation is relevant.וְהִתְפַּשְּׁטוּת הָאוֹר;

The diffusion of the light subdivides into two levels.וּבְהִתְפַּשְׁטוּת הָאוֹר ב' מַדְרֵגוֹת:

a) The revelation of light for G‑d Himself. On this level, there is no conception of existence outside of Him. His light is revealed, not for others, but as a natural function of the light itself. G‑d has the potential to shine forth light and that potential seeks expression.גִּלּוּי הָאוֹר כְּמוֹ שֶׁהוּא לְעַצְמוֹ

This revelation is the source of the light of _sovev kol almin_, the light that _transcends_ (lit.: “encompasses”)all worlds; andשֶׁזֶּהוּ מְקוֹר אוֹר הַסּוֹבֵב,

b) The revelation of the light that bears a relation to the worlds – as it is for Himself.וְגִלּוּי הָאוֹר לְעַצְמוֹ הַשַּׁיָּךְ לְהָעוֹלָמוֹת

The _[maamar](/multimedia/video_cdo/aid/1466847/jewish/Introduction-to-a-Chassidic-Discourse.htm "Introduction to a Chassidic Discourse")_ is referring to the light that is intended to be enclothed within the worlds as it exists in a preparatory stage, i.e., before the _tzimtzum_.

This revelation is the source of the light of memale kol almin, the light that is internalized in all the worlds.שֶׁזֶּהוּ מְקוֹר אוֹר הַמְמַלֵּא,

To explain by analogy, it is like a person who prepares the message he wants to communicate to others in his own mind. The message (i.e., the light) is intended for others (i.e., to bring about the existence of the worlds that appear as entities separate from Him). Nevertheless, on this level, it is still in the person’s own mind. In the analogue, the light shines before the _tzimtzum_ and thus, there is no concept of existence outside of Him.

It is this latter illumination that is termed _Shechinah_.וְגִלּוּי הָאוֹר הַזֶּה נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה.

Seemingly, this term is not relevant, for this light is, by definition, _above_ the worlds.

True, this light precedes the _tzimtzum_ and thus cannot possibly serve as a source for the creation of the worlds –וְאַף שֶׁהוּא לִפְנֵי הַצִּמְצוּם וְאִי אֶפְשָׁר שֶׁיִּהְיֶה מָקוֹר לָעוֹלָמוֹת,

For before the _tzimtzum_, even the light that was intended to shine within the worlds was included within His unlimited light.

for which reason it was necessary that there be a _tzimtzum_. Moreover, a unique type of _tzimtzum_ –שֶׁלָּכֵן הֻצְרַךְ לִהְיוֹת הַצִּמְצוּם,

the first _tzimtzum_, which involved a complete withdrawal of _G‑d’s_ light.וְצִמְצוּם הָרִאשׁוֹן שֶׁהוּא בִּבְחִינַת סִלּוּק דַּוְקָא,

All of the subsequent _tzimtzum_im involve a mere reduction of Divine light. In this instance, in order for the worlds to come into existence, a complete withdrawal of the light is necessary.

Nevertheless, despite it being _above_ the level of the worldsמִכָּל מָקוֹם

this light is termed _Shechinah_. The term is appropriate based on the explanation of the [Rebbe Maharash](/library/article_cdo/aid/626953/jewish/The-Rebbe-Maharash.htm "The Rebbe Maharash") given _above_. In this instance as well, the ultimate intent of this light is that it would descend and enclothe itself in the worlds that would come into being.נִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם שְׁכִינָה.

On this basis, we can understand the precise wording of the _Midrash_: “the essence of the _Shechinah_ was manifest in the lower realms,” i.e., our material world.וְזֶהוּ דִּיּוּק הַלָּשׁוֹן 'עִיקַּר שְׁכִינָה בַּתַּחְתּוֹנִים הָיְתָה',

The revelation of the _Shechinah_ in the lower realms refersהַיְינוּ שֶׁגִּלּוּי הַשְּׁכִינָה בַּתַּחְתּוֹנִים, הוּא

not to the term _Shechinah_ as it applies in relation to _Atzilus_, i.e., _Malchus_,לֹא הַשְּׁכִינָה כְּמוֹ שֶׁהוּא לְגַבֵּי אֲצִילוּת, הַיְינוּ מַלְכוּת,

nor the term _Shechinah_ as it applies in relation to _G‑d’s_ infinite light, i.e., the _kav_.גַּם לֹא כְּמוֹ שֶׁהוּא לְגַבֵּי אוֹר אֵין סוֹף, הַיְינוּ הַקַּו,

Instead, it was the essence and innermost dimension of the _Shechinah_ that was manifest in the lower realms, our material earth.כִּי אִם עִיקַּר וּפְנִימִיּוּת הַשְּׁכִינָה הָיְתָה בַּתַּחְתּוֹנִים דַּוְקָא,

Why is it necessary for the _Midrash_ to say that the essence of the _Shechinah_ was manifest in the lower realms? Because the _Midrash_ is commenting on the verse, “I came into My garden,” which implies that not only was G‑dliness manifest in this world, but it was manifest in this world to a greater extent than in the spiritual realms _above_. The only level of G‑dliness that could be referred to as “I” and still be manifest in this world to a greater degree than in the higher realms is _G‑d’s_ light that shined before the _tzimtzum_. As the _maamar_ explains,

The Divine light enclothed within the worlds descends in an orderly and progressive manner.[14](javascript:doFootnote\('14a115101'\);)כִּי הָאוֹר שֶׁנִּתְלַבֵּשׁ בָּעוֹלָמוֹת הֲרֵי הוּא בָּא בְּסֵדֶר וְהַדְרָגָה.

In the loftier realms, _G‑d’s_ light is revealed to a greater degree,וּלְמַעְלָה מֵאִיר בְּגִלּוּי יוֹתֵר,

and the greater the extent of the descent through the chainlike pattern of existence, the lesser the illumination.וְכָל מַה שֶּׁנִּמְשָׁךְ וּמִשְׁתַּלְשֵׁל, מִתְמַעֵט הָאוֹר.

Hence, following that pattern, the G‑dly light that would be enclothed in this world would be of an extremely low level. It would not be appropriate to say that the verse “I came into My garden” refers to such a light.

For this pattern of descent characterizes the Divine light manifest within Seder HaHishtalshelus (the chainlike pattern of spiritual existence)[15](javascript:doFootnote\('15a115101'\);) as a whole. All levels following the _tzimtzum_ follow that pattern – the loftier the realm, the greater the degree of revelation; the lower the realm, the lesser the degree of revelation. Hence, this light could not be manifest in this world to a greater degree than in the higher realms.וְכֵן הוּא בִּכְלָל בָּאוֹר דְּסֵדֶר הִשְׁתַּלְשְׁלוּת.

True, before the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, G‑dly light was revealed in this world. Thus, it could be said that before the sin, when G‑dliness was revealed in this world, the G‑dly light that was revealed there surpassed that of the higher realms. This, however, cannot be said, becauseוְאַף שֶׁקֹּדֶם הַחֵטְא הָיָה גַּם לְמַטָּה הָאוֹר בְּגִלּוּי,

Nevertheless, even then, the light was revealed to a greater extent in the higher worlds.מִכָּל מָקוֹם הָיָה גַּם אָז גִּלּוּי הָאוֹר יוֹתֵר לְמַעְלָה.

As our Sages state,[16](javascript:doFootnote\('16a115101'\);) “He extended His right hand and created heaven; He extended His left hand and created earth.”וּכְמַאֲמַר רַזַ"ל נָטָה יְמִינוֹ וּבָרָא שָׁמַיִם, נָטָה שְׂמֹאלוֹ וּבָרָא אָרֶץ.

Just as in a physical sense, the left hand is weaker and thus the right hand denotes primacy, so too, in a spiritual sense, the heavens – the spiritual realms – were created with _G‑d’s_ right hand, i.e., they received a greater degree of Divine light. And the earth – this material world – was created with His left hand, i.e., it received a lesser degree of Divine light. This verse is referring to the time before the sin, i.e., the world directly after its creation. Nevertheless, the pattern was that the loftier the realm, the greater the light that shined in it.

Instead, the intent is _G‑d’s_ light that _transcends_ the worlds, the light that shined before the _tzimtzum_. Since that light _transcends_ the entire Spiritual Cosmos and all its prevailing patterns, it is possible that it be manifest in this material realm to a greater degree than in the spiritual realms.אֶלָּא הַכַּוָּנָה עַל הָאוֹר שֶׁלְּמַעְלָה מֵעוֹלָמוֹת,

This is what is meant by the essence of the _Shechinah_, that this sublime level of G‑dly light was manifest in our material world.עִיקַּר שְׁכִינָה.

### Summary

The _maamar_ is based on a verse from _Shir HaShirim_, which serves as an analogy for the ongoing love relationship between G‑d and His bride, the Jewish people. In its description of the descent of the _Shechinah_, the Divine Presence, into the world at the time of the Giving of the Torah and the construction of the Sanctuary, the _Midrash_ quotes the verse: “I have come into My garden, My sister, My bride.” The _Midrash_ observes that the verse does not use the term _legan_ which would mean “to the garden,” but _legan_i which means “to My garden,” i.e., a place to which the _Shechinah_ shared a previous connection. On that basis, our Sages conclude that originally, “the essence of the _Shechinah_ was manifest in the lower realms.”

The _maamar_ emphasizes that the term _Shechinah_ is used to refer to several different levels depending on the rung of the Spiritual Cosmos about which it is speaking. When speaking of the _Shechinah_ that was manifest in this physical world, however, the intent is the essence and innermost dimension of the _Shechinah_.
