# Basi Legani - 5711: Chapter 5 - Chabad.org


This section continues the discussions of the concepts mentioned in the preceding one: that the ultimate intent of creation is this material world and not the loftier, spiritual worlds.

It goes without saying that the _above_ statement applies[1](javascript:doFootnote\('1a115146'\);) according to the opinion cited by the Tzemach Tzedek[2](javascript:doFootnote\('2a115146'\);)וְהִנֵּה לָא מִבָּעֵי לְהַשִּׁיטָה שֶׁמֵּבִיא אַדְמוֹ"ר הַצֶּמַח צֶדֶק

that even the vessels of _Atzilus_ are but a revelation of what was previously concealed.שֶׁגַּם הַכֵּלִים דַּאֲצִילוּת הוּא גִּלּוּי הַהֶעְלֵם,

The _Sefiros_ of _[Atzilus](/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/431124/jewish/Close-to-the-Light.htm "Close to the Light")_ are comprised of _oros_ (“lights”) – the dynamic energy of the _[Sefiros](/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380812/jewish/Emanations-Interact.htm "Emanations Interact")_ – and _keilim_ (“vessels”), the medium through which the _[oros](/library/article_cdo/aid/2788328/jewish/Everywhere-Revealed.htm "Everywhere Revealed")_ are given definition and associated with the particular attribute that is manifest through a given __Sefirah_._

The phrase _gilui_ hahelem, “a revelation of what was previously concealed,” is certainly an appropriate description for the lights of _Atzilus_. These lights are rooted in the transcendent realms of G‑dliness _above_ that world. Nevertheless, in those transcendent realms, they are too elevated to shine in a revealed manner. As they descend into _Atzilus_, they are condensed and given form to the extent that their light can be revealed to lower levels.

With regard to the _[keilim](/library/article_cdo/aid/163324/jewish/Keli-Rishon-Sheini-and-Shlishi.htm "Chapter 3 - The Laws of Keli Rishon, Sheini and Shlishi")_ of _Atzilus_, by contrast, there is a difference of opinion among the kabbalists. Some maintain that they are also no more than _gilui_ hahelem, “a revelation of what was previously concealed,” for they too are rooted in a higher source. That source is hidden and, as _Atzilus_ comes into being, the qualities of that source are revealed.

According to the latter opinion, the logic – that creation would not be brought into being for the sake of a descent – mentioned in the previous section still applies.דִּלְשִׁיטָה זוֹ

Certainly, the ultimate intent of creation is not for _Atzilus_,הֲרֵי בְּוַדַּאי אֵין הַכַּוָּנָה בִּשְׁבִיל הָאֲצִילוּת

for the fact that _Atzilus_ came into being involves a descent, i.e., both the _oros_ and the _keilim_ were on a higher level in their sourcesכִּי הֲרֵי זֶה יְרִידָה

and they are merely revealed levels of G‑dliness, while the creation involves _G‑d’s_ Essence. As explained in the previous section, it cannot be said that _[G‑d](/library/article_cdo/aid/433240/jewish/God.htm "God in Judaism")’s_ Essence acts for the sake of the revealed levels of G‑dliness.וְרַק גִּלּוּיִם,

There is, however, a second opinion among the kabbalists, as cited in that source,אֶלָּא גַּם לְהַשִּׁיטָה הַשְּׁנִיָּה שֶׁמֵּבִיא שָׁם

that the _[keilim](/library/article_cdo/aid/3201311/jewish/Covert-Luminosity.htm "Covert Luminosity")_ are creations brought into being out of nothingness.שֶׁהַכֵּלִים הֵם בְּרִיאָה יֵשׁ מֵאַיִן,

For in _Atzilus_, the _keilim_ are entities with definition and form with a distinct identity. Hence, they can be termed _yesh_, “something,” and therefore, considered a new entity. Accordingly, it might be said that _G‑d’s_ intent in creation is vested in them.

It is explained in various sources[3](javascript:doFootnote\('3a115146'\);)הִנֵּה מְבֹאָר בְּכַמָּה מְקוֹמוֹת

that the description of the _keilim_ as creations brought into being out of nothingness is a relative statement.שֶׁמַּה שֶּׁאָנוּ אוֹמְרִים שֶׁהַכֵּלִים הֵם בְּרִיאָה יֵשׁ מֵאַיִן,

The intent is not that, in an absolute sense, they are entities of actual substance (_yesh_) that are brought into being from nothingness.אֵין הַכַּוָּנָה יֵשׁ מֵאַיִן מַמָּשׁ,

For even the _keilim_ of _Atzilus_ are _Elokus_, G‑dliness, and cannot be described with the term _yesh_. Even though each _[Sefirah](/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380812/jewish/Emanations-Interact.htm "Emanations Interact")_ has its own identity – _Chochmah_ (“wisdom”) is distinct from _Binah_ (“understanding”); _Chessed_ (“kindness”) is distinct from _Gewurah_ (“might”) etc. – all of these (and the other six _Sefiros_) are subsumed within _G‑d’s_ light to the extent that they are totally identified with G‑dliness and do not see themselves as independent entities. For example, the _[Chessed](/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380796/jewish/Chesed-Gewura-Tiferet.htm "<i>Chesed, Gewura, & Tiferet</i>")_ of _Atzilus_ is the radiation of _G‑d’s_ love and kindness. In contrast, the _Chessed_ of _Beriah_ is the _angels_’ love for G‑d.

Instead, they are considered as __yesh_ me’ayin_, new entities coming into being from nothingness, only in relation to the light that shines within them.כִּי אִם זֶהוּ דַּוְקָא לְגַבֵּי הָאוֹר,

The source of the _keilim_ is from the _reshimah_, the imprint left after the withdrawal of Divine light (through the first _tzimtzum_),מִפְּנֵי שֶׁשֹּׁרֶשׁ הַכֵּלִים מֵהָרְשִׁימָה

which is characterized by hiddenness.שֶׁהִיא בְּחִינַת הֶעְלֵם,

The vessels therefore exist in such a way that their source is hidden from them.וְלָכֵן גַּם מְצִיאוּתָן הוּא בְּאֹפֶן שֶׁמְּקוֹרָם בְּהֶעְלֵם,

The lights, on the other hand, are extensions of their source. Like the lights themselves, their source is also characterized by the tendency to revelation, but it is too abstract to be revealed and manifest. The lights of _Atzilus_ bring into revelation those lights which are too transcendent to be revealed. Hence, the connection between the lights and their source is apparent. The _reshimah_, the source of the _keilim_, by contrast, is characterized by hiddenness and a tendency to withdrawal. Hence, when _keilim_ come into existence from the _reshimah_, they appear as new entities.

Thus, relative to the lights, the _keilim_ can be considered as __yesh_ me’ayin_, new entities created from nothingness.וְלָכֵן לְגַבֵּי הָאוֹר הֵם כְּמוֹ בְּרִיאָה יֵשׁ מֵאַיִן,

However, in relation to their source, the _reshimah_, they are indeed revelations of that which was previously concealed, for the potential for the _keilim_ existed beforehand.אֲבָל לְגַבֵּי הָרְשִׁימָה הֵם גִּלּוּי הַהֶעְלֵם,

Since both the lights and the _keilim_ of the _Sefiros_ of _Atzilus_ are revelations of the energies that existed on a higher level before,

it is thus clear that the ultimate Divine objective in creation is not the higher worlds, since, as explained in sec. 4, this involves a descent,אִם כֵּן מוּבָן דְּאֵין הַכַּוָּנָה עוֹלָמוֹת הָעֶלְיוֹנִים

but the objective is, instead, this material world where man will serve G‑d by subduing darkness and transforming it into light, as explained by the Rebbe Rajatz in his _maamar_ _Basi LeGani_ and elaborated upon in this _[maamar](/multimedia/video_cdo/aid/1466847/jewish/Introduction-to-a-Chassidic-Discourse.htm "Introduction to a Chassidic Discourse")_ in the subsequent sections.כִּי אִם הָעֲבוֹדָה בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה דְּאִתְכַּפְיָא וְאִתְהַפְּכָא.

Another question can be raised concerning the concept that our material world represents the purpose of creation. It is stated[4](javascript:doFootnote\('4a115146'\);)

that, at present, our observance of _mitzvos_ increases the light within _Atzilus_.וְאַף שֶׁעַכְשָׁו הִנֵּה עַל יְדֵי עֲשִׂיַּת הַמִּצְוֹת מוֹסִיפִים אוֹרוֹת בָּאֲצִילוּת,

If so, how can we then say that even at present, the ultimate objective of creation is specifically this world? Even if, as explained, in the Era of _Maschiach_, these lights will ultimately be revealed in this world, nevertheless, at present, it appears that the intent is the world of _Atzilus_.וְאִם כֵּן אֵיךְ אָנוּ אוֹמְרִים שֶׁגַּם עַכְשָׁו עִיקַּר הַכַּוָּנָה הָעוֹלָם הַזֶּה דַּוְקָא,

The resolution to this question can be understood on the basis of the Rebbe Maharash’s explanation[5](javascript:doFootnote\('5a115146'\);) that these lights are, by way of analogy, “stored in a chest” in _Atzilus_.הִנֵּה עַל זֶה מְבָאֵר אַדְמוֹ"ר מהר"ש שֶׁאוֹרוֹת אֵלּוּ בָּאֲצִילוּת הֵם שָׁם כְּמֻנָּחִים בְּקֻפְסָא,

For they are not intended for _Atzilus_כִּי אֵינָם בִּשְׁבִיל אֲצִילוּת,

but for this lowly world, where they will be revealed with the arrival of _[Maschiach](/library/article_cdo/aid/332562/jewish/Moshiach-101.htm "Moshiach (Messiah) and the Future Redemption")_.כִּי אִם לְצֹרֶךְ עוֹלָם הַתַּחְתּוֹן

Indeed, they are not revealed in _Atzilus_ even at present when they are “stored” there. Thus the fact that our Divine service generates light in _Atzilus_ does not contradict the concept stated _above_: that the ultimate purpose of Creation is for G‑dliness to be drawn down into this material world.וְאֵינָם מִתְגַּלִּים בָּאֲצִילוּת.

On this basis, we can understand the Rebbe Ra­shab’s explanation[6](javascript:doFootnote\('6a115146'\);) of the _above_ quotation from _Tanya_ that it is impossible to postulate that “ultimately, the progressive, chainlike descent of the worlds is intended for the loftier worlds, but rather for this world,וְזֶהוּ מַה שֶּׁמְּבָאֵר אַדְמוֹ"ר נ"ע בְּעִנְיָן מַה שֶּׁאִי אֶפְשָׁר לוֹמַר שֶׁהַכַּוָּנָה הוּא בִּשְׁבִיל עוֹלָמוֹת הָעֶלְיוֹנִים

since this constitutes a descent from the light of _G‑d’s_ countenance for these loftier realms.”הוֹאִיל וְלָהֶם יְרִידָה מֵאוֹר פָּנָיו יִתְבָּרֵךְ,

The explanation is that the higher worlds are characterized by revelation, which implies descent, i.e., that light that was on a higher level descends to such an extent that it can be revealed to beings on a lower plane.שֶׁהַפֵּרוּשׁ בָּזֶה הוּא דְּעוֹלָמוֹת עֶלְיוֹנִים עִנְיָנָם גִּלּוּיִם שֶׁזֶּהוּ יְרִידָה,

Moreover, _G‑d’s_ Essence is entirely removed from the quality of revelation. Hence, inherently, all revelation involves a descent from _G‑d’s_ Essence.וְגַם שֶׁהָעַצְמוּת מֻבְדָּל מֵעִנְיַן הַגִּלּוּיִם,

The ultimate objective of creation is this lowly world,אֶלָּא הַתַּכְלִית הוּא עוֹלָם הַזֶּה הַתַּחְתּוֹן,

for it arose in _G‑d’s_ will that He experience delight “when the forces of evil are subdued[7](javascript:doFootnote\('7a115146'\);) – which comes about through a person’s exercise of self-control, holding back and refraining from indulging his natural desires and drives –שֶׁכָּךְ עָלָה בִּרְצוֹנוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ לִהְיוֹת נַחַת רוּחַ לְפָנָיו יִתְבָּרֵךְ כַּד אִתְכַּפְיָא סִטְרָא אַחֲרָא

and darkness is converted into light.”[8](javascript:doFootnote\('8a115146'\);) This reflects an even higher rung of service, transforming negative influences into positive ones.וְאִתְהַפְּכָא חֲשׁוֹכָא לִנְהוֹרָא,

It is written,[9](javascript:doFootnote\('9a115146'\);) “...like the superiority of light over darkness.” _Chassidus_[10](javascript:doFootnote\('10a115146'\);) explains that the phrase translated as “over darkness” actually reads _min hachoshech_, “from the darkness.” Implied is that there are two levels of light: ordinary light and a superior light that is produced by the transformation of darkness into light. _G‑d’s_ desire in creating our material world was to bring darkness into being and for man to transform that darkness into the higher quality of light.

As the [Rebbe Rajatz](/library/article_cdo/aid/3573646/jewish/The-Previous-Rebbe.htm "The Previous Rebbe") explains in the _maamar_ _Basi LeGani_,[11](javascript:doFootnote\('11a115146'\);)וּכְמוֹ שֶׁמְּבָאֵר בְּהַמַּאֲמָר,

the totality of our Divine service involves transforming the folly of the forces of evil to the folly of holiness. (See the following section which elaborates on this theme.)שֶׁכָּל הָעֲבוֹדָה הוּא לַהֲפֹךְ הַשְּׁטוּת דִּלְעֻמַּת זֶה לִשְׁטוּת דִּקְדֻשָּׁה,

This brings about the Divine satisfaction as expressed by the phrase, “I derive pleasure from the fact that I spoke and My will was carried out.”[12](javascript:doFootnote\('12a115146'\);)וְעַל יְדֵי זֶה נַחַת רוּחַ לְפָנַי שֶׁאָמַרְתִּי וְנַעֲשָׂה רְצוֹנִי,

The reference to _G‑d’s_ will in this quote, and the expression “it arose in _G‑d’s_ will” cited _above_, indicate that the fact that the higher quality of light is brought about through the transformation of darkness into light is a consequence of _G‑d’s_ will. True, this pattern is embedded in the fabric of the world’s existence, but that is so only because G‑d so desired, not because of a logical necessity that it be so.

Through such transformation, a dwelling for G‑d is drawn down into this lower world.וְעַל יְדֵי זֶה מַמְשִׁיכִים שֶׁיִּהְיֶה לוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ דִּירָה בַּתַּחְתּוֹנִים,

Just as a person’s entire essence and being becomes manifest in his home,[13](javascript:doFootnote\('13a115146'\);)וּכְמוֹ הַדִּירָה הֲרֵי הָאָדָם דָּר בָּהּ בְּכָל עַצְמוּתוֹ וּמַהוּתוֹ,

so too, _G‑d’s_ Essence will be manifest within our world.הִנֵּה כְּמוֹ כֵן הוּא בַּתַּחְתּוֹנִים שֶׁהֵם דִּירָה לוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ,

When a person goes outside, he dresses and conducts himself in a manner suited to the people and settings he will confront, adapting his dress and his behavior according to the prevailing norms. At home, he does as he wants, clothing himself and conducting himself as he desires, giving expression to the very essence of who he is.

Similarly in the analogue, on all the different levels of the Spiritual Cosmos, G‑dliness is revealed according to “the prevailing norms,” the structure of that given world. This world, by contrast, is His dwelling. Here, He reveals His Essence.

This is the intent of our Divine service: to draw down not only the revealed levels of Divine light,הַכַּוָּנָה שֶׁמַּמְשִׁיכִים לֹא רַק גִּלּוּיִם

but to have _G‑d’s_ very Essence manifest within our material world.כִּי אִם נִמְצָא בָּהֶם עַצְמוּת אֵין סוֹף בָּרוּךְ הוּא.

This is the ultimate purpose of the creation and the downward progression of all the worlds.וְזֶהוּ תַּכְלִית בְּרִיאַת וְהִשְׁתַּלְשְׁלוּת הָעוֹלָמוֹת.

### Summary

This section continues the discussions of the concepts mentioned in the preceding one: that the ultimate intent of creation is this material world and not the loftier, spiritual worlds, since for those realms the process of creation constitutes a descent from the light of _G‑d’s_ countenance.

The _maamar_ raises a question concerning that statement based on a difference of opinion found in certain kabbalistic texts as to the nature of the _Sefiros_ of _Atzilus_. One opinion maintains that not only the _oros_ (“lights”) of _Atzilus_, but also the _keilim_ (“vessels”) of _Atzilus_ are revelations of spiritual forces that existed on a higher level before _Atzilus_ came into being. According to that opinion, there is no difficulty with the statements made in the previous section, because the descent also involves the _keilim_. However, according to the opinion that the _keilim_ of _Atzilus_ are considered as having been brought into being __yesh_ me’[ayin](/library/article_cdo/aid/1074094/jewish/Something-About-Nothing.htm "Something About Nothing")_, from nothingness, one might say that _G‑d’s_ intent for creation was vested in them.

Nevertheless, the description of the _keilim_ as creations brought into being out of nothingness is a relative statement. The intent is not that, in an absolute sense, they are entities of actual substance (_yesh_) that are brought into being from nothingness. Instead, they are considered as __yesh_ me’ayin_ only in relation to the light that shines within them. In relation to their source, the _reshimah_, they are indeed revelations of that which was previously concealed.

Another question can be raised concerning the concept that our material world represents the purpose of creation. It is stated that, at present, our observance of _[mitzvos](/library/article_cdo/aid/1438516/jewish/Mitzvah.htm "What Is a Mitzvah?")_ increases the light within _Atzilus_. If so, how can we then say that the ultimate objective of creation is specifically this world?

This question can be resolved based on the explanation that these lights are by way of analogy, “stored in a chest” in _Atzilus_, but the intent is that they be revealed in this world.

Thus, the purpose of creation is that a dwelling for G‑d be created in this world by subduing its darkness and transforming it into light, and transforming the folly of the forces of evil into the folly of holiness.
